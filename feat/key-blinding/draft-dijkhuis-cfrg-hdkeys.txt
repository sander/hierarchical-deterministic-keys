1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the algorithms to apply Hierarchical
   Deterministic Keys (HDKeys).  The purpose of an HDK architecture is
   to manage large sets of keys bound to a secure cryptographic device
   that protects a single key.  This enables the development of secure
   digital identity wallets providing many one-time-use public keys.

   The core idea has been introduced in [BIP32] to create multiple
   cryptocurrency addresses in a manageable way.  The present document
   extends the idea towards devices commonly used for digital wallets,
   and towards common interaction patterns for document issuance and
   authentication.

   To store many HDKeys, only a seed string needs to be confidentially
   stored, associated with a device private key.  Each HDK is then
   deterministically defined by a path of indices, optionally alternated
   by key handles provided by another party.  Such a path can
   efficiently be stored and requires less confidentiality than the
   seed.

   To prove possession of many HDKeys, the secure cryptographic device
   only needs to perform common cryptographic operations on a single
   key.  The HDK acts as a blinding factor that enables blinding the
   device public key.

   This document provides a specification of the generic HDK function,
   generic HDK instantiations, and fully specified concrete HDK
   instantiations.

   An HDK instantiation is expected to be applied in a solution deployed
   as (wallet) units.  One unit can have multiple HDK instantiations,
   for example to manage multiple identities or multiple cryptographic
   algorithms or key protection mechanisms.

   This document represents the consensus of the authors, based on
   working group input and feedback.  It is not a standard.  It does not
   include security or privacy proofs.

1.1.  Conventions and definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following notation is used throughout the document.

   *  byte: A sequence of eight bits.

   *  I2OSP(n, w): Convert non-negative integer n to a w-length, big-
      endian byte string, as described in [RFC8017].

2.  The Hierarchical Deterministic Key function

   An HDK instantiation enables local key derivation to create many key
   pairs from a single seed value.  It enables remote parties to
   generate key handles from which both parties can derive more key
   pairs asynchronously.  Additionally, an HDK instantiation enables
   securely proving possession of the private keys, such as required in
   [RFC7800], either in a centralised or in a distributed manner.

   Solutions MAY omit application of the remote functionality.  In this
   case, a unit can only derive keys locally.

2.1.  Introductory examples

2.1.1.  Local deterministic key derivation

   The following example illustrates the use of local key derivation.
   An HDK tree is associated with a device key pair and initiated using
   confidential static data: a seed value, which is a byte array
   containing sufficient entropy.  Now tree nodes are constructed as
   follows.

                             +----+
   Confidential static data: |seed|
                             +-+--+
                               v
                             +----+ +----+
   Level 0 HDKeys:           |hdk0| |hdk1|
                             +-+--+ +----+
                               v
                             +-----+ +-----+ +-----+
   Level 1 HDKeys:           |hdk00| |hdk01| |hdk02|
                             +-----+ ++---++ +-----+
                                      v   v
                                +------+ +------+
   Level 2 HDKeys at hdk01:     |hdk000| |hdk001| ...
                                +------+ +------+

   The unit computes a Level 0 HDK at the root node using a
   deterministic function: (bf0, salt0) = hdk0 = HDK(seed, 0).  The HDK
   consists of a first blinding factor bf0 and a first byte string salt0
   to derive next-level keys.  Using bf0 and the device key pair, the
   unit can compute blinded public and private keys and proofs of
   possession.

   The unit computes any Level n > 0 HDK from any other HDK (bf, salt)
   using the same deterministic function: (bf', salt') = hdk' =
   HDK(salt, index).  The function takes the previous-level salt as
   input, and an index starting at 0.  The function returns a new HDK as
   output, which can be used in the same way as the root HDK.

2.1.2.  Remote deterministic key derivation

   Instead of local derivation, an HDK salt can also be derived using a
   key handle that is generated remotely.  Using the derived salt, the
   local and remote parties can derive the same new HDKeys.  The remote
   party can use these to derive public keys.  The local party can use
   these to derive associated private keys for proof of possession.

   This approach is similar to Asynchronous Remote Key Generation (ARKG)
   [I-D.draft-bradleylundberg-cfrg-arkg-02], but not the same since ARKG
   does not enable distributed proof of possession with deterministic
   hierarchies.  This makes it difficult to implement with cryptographic
   devices that lack specific firmware support.

   To enable remote derivation of child HDKeys, the unit uses the parent
   HDKey to derive the parent public key and a second public key for key
   encapsulation.  The issuer returns a key handle, using which both
   parties can derive a sequence of child HDKeys.  Key encapsulation
   prevents other parties from discovering a link between the public
   keys of the parent and the children, even if the other party knows
   the parent HDK or can eavesdrop communications.

   Locally derived parents can have remotely derived children.  Remotely
   derived parents can have locally derived children.

2.1.3.  Blinded proof of possession

   The next concept to illustrate is blinded proof of possession.  This
   enables a unit to prove possession of a (device) private key without
   disclosing the directly associated public key.  This way, solutions
   can avoid linkability across readers of a digital document that is
   released with proof of possession.

   In this example, a document is issued with binding to a public key
   pk', which is a blinding public key pk blinded with the blinding
   factor bf in some HDK hdk = (bf, salt).  The unit can present the
   document with a proof of possession of the corresponding blinded
   private key, which is the blinding private key sk blinded with bf.
   The unit applies some authentication function device_data =
   authenticate(sk, reader_data, bf) to the blinding private key,
   reader-provided data and the blinding factor.  The unit can
   subsequently use the output device_data to prove possession to the
   reader using common algorithms.

       |    |           |    |
            +-----------+

   The reader does not need to be aware that an HDK function or key
   blinding was used, since for common algorithms, the blinded public
   key and the proof are indistinguishable from non-blinded keys and
   proofs.

   When applied on HDK level n, the blinding private key sk is the
   device private key blinded with a combination of n blinding factors.
   These can either be combined within the secure cryptographic device,
   by subsequent computation of the blinded private key starting with
   the device private key, or outside of the secure cryptographic
   device, by combining the blinding factors outside of the secure
   cryptographic device.

   Blinding methods can be constructed such that the secure
   cryptographic device does not need to be designed for key blinding.
   In such cases, the computation of device_data is distributed between
   two parties: the secure cryptographic device using common
   cryptographic operations, and the unit component invoking these
   operations.  Some blinded proof of possession algorithms can only be
   centralised.

2.2.  Instantiation parameters

   The parameters of an HDK instantiation are:

   *  ID: A domain separation tag, represented as a string of ASCII
      bytes.

   *  Ns: The amount of bytes of a salt value with sufficient entropy.

   *  H: A cryptographic hash function.

      -  H1(msg): Outputs Ns bytes.

   *  BL: An asymmetric key blinding scheme with opaque blinding factors
      and algebraic properties, consisting of the functions:

      -  BL-Generate-Blinding-Key-Pair(): Outputs a blinding key pair
         (pk, sk).

      -  BL-Derive-Blinding-Factor(msg, ctx): Outputs a blinding factor
         bf based on two byte string inputs, message msg and domain
         separation parameter ctx.

      -  BL-Blind-Public-Key(pk, bf): Outputs the result pk' of blinding
         pk with bf.  This again is a blinding public key.

      -  BL-Blind-Private-Key(sk, bf): Outputs the result sk' of
         blinding sk with bf.  This again is a blinding private key.

      -  BL-Combine-Blinding-Factors(bf1, bf2): Outputs a blinding
         factor bf such that for all blinding key pairs (pk, sk):

         o  BL-Blind-Public-Key(pk, bf) == BL-Blind-Public-Key(BL-Blind-
            Public-Key(pk, bf1), bf2)

         o  BL-Blind-Private-Key(pk, bf) == BL-Blind-Private-Key(BL-
            Blind-Private-Key(pk, bf1), bf2)

   *  KEM: A key encapsulation mechanism [RFC9180], consisting of the
      functions:

      -  KEM-Derive-Key-Pair(ikm): Outputs a key encapsulation key pair
         (sk, pk).

      -  KEM-Encap(pk): Outputs (k, c) consisting of a shared secret k
         and a ciphertext c, taking key encapsulation public key pk.

      -  KEM-Decap(c, sk): Outputs shared secret k, taking ciphertext c
         and key encapsulation private key sk.

   *  Authenticate(sk_device, reader_data, bf): Outputs device_data for
      use in a protocol for proof of possession, taking a BL blinding
      private key sk_device, remotely received reader_data, and a BL
      blinding factor bf.

   An HDK instantiation MUST specify the instantiation of each of the
   above functions and values.

   An HDK instantiation MUST define Authenticate such that the
   device_data can be verified using the blinded public key pk = BL-
   Blind-Public-Key(sk, bf).  The reader does not need to know that HDK
   was applied: the public key will look like any other public key used
   for proofs of possession.

2.3.  The HDK function

   A local unit or a remote party deterministically computes an HDK from
   a salt and an index.  The salt can be an initial seed value of Ns
   bytes or it can be taken from another parent HDK.  The secure
   generation of the seed is out of scope for this specification.

   Inputs:
   - salt, a string of Ns bytes.
   - index, an integer between 0 and 2^32-1 (inclusive).

   Outputs:
   - bf, the blinding factor at the provided index.
   - salt', the salt for HDK derivation at the provided index.

   def HDK(salt, index):
       msg = salt || I2OSP(index, 4)
       bf = BL-Derive-Blinding-Factor(msg, ID)
       salt' = H1(msg)
       return (bf, salt')

2.4.  The local HDK procedure

   This is a procedure executed locally by a unit.

   To begin, the unit securely generates a seed salt of Ns bytes and a
   device key pair:

   seed = random(Ns) # specification of random out of scope
   (pk_device, sk_device) = BL-Generate-Blinding-Key-Pair()

   The unit MUST generate sk_device within a secure cryptographic
   device.

   Whenever the unit requires the HDK with some index at level 0, the
   unit computes:

   (bf, salt) = HDK(seed, index)

   pk = BL-Blind-Public-Key( pk_device, bf) # optional
   sk = BL-Blind-Private-Key(sk_device, bf) # optional

   Now the unit can use the blinded key pair (pk, sk) or derive child
   HDKeys.

   Whenever the unit requires the HDK with some index at level n > 0
   based on a parent HDK hdk = (bf, salt) with blinded key pair (pk, sk)
   at level n, the unit computes:

   (bf', salt') = HDK(salt, index)

   pk' = BL-Blind-Public-Key( pk, bf') # optional
   sk' = BL-Blind-Private-Key(sk, bf') # optional

   Now the unit can use the blinded key pair (pk', sk') or derive child
   HDKeys.

2.5.  The remote HDK protocol

   This is a protocol between a local unit and a remote issuer.

   As a prerequisite, the unit possesses a salt of Ns bytes associated
   with a parent blinding key pair (pk, sk) generated using the local
   HDK procedure.

   # 1. Unit computes:
   (sk_kem, pk_kem) = KEM-Derive-Key-Pair(salt)

   # 2. Unit shares with issuer: (pk, pk_kem)

   # 3. Issuer computes:
   (salt, kh) = KEM-Encap(pk_kem)

   # 4. Issuer shares with unit: kh

   # Subsequently, for any index known to both parties:

   # 5. Issuer computes:
   (bf, salt') = HDK(salt, index)
   pk' = BL-Blind-Public-Key(pk, bf)

   # 6. Issuer shares with unit: pk'

   # 7. Unit verifies integrity:
   salt' = KEM-Decap(kh, sk_kem)
   (bf, salt'') = HDK(salt', index)
   pk' == BL-Blind-Public-Key(pk, bf)

   # 8. Unit computes:
   sk' = BL-Blind-Private-Key(sk, bf)

   After step 7, the unit can use the value of salt'' to derive next-
   level HDKeys.

   Step 4 MAY be postponed to be combined with step 6.  Steps 5 to 8 MAY
   be combined in concurrent execution for multiple indices.

2.6.  Combining blinding factors

   A unit MUST not persist a blinded private key.  Instead, if
   persistence is needed, a unit can persist either the blinding factor
   of each HDK, or a path consisting of the seed salt, indices and key
   handles.  In both cases, the unit needs to combine parent blinding
   factor bf1 with child blinding factor bf2 before blinding the parent
   private key sk:

   bf = BL-Combine-Blinding-Factors(bf1, bf2)

   Subsequently, the unit can apply the Authenticate function to the
   parent blinding key.  The unit can combine multiple blinding factors
   in the HDK path.

   If the unit uses the blinded private key directly, the unit MUST use
   it within the secure cryptographic device protecting the device
   private key.

   If the unit uses the blinded private key directly, the unit MUST
   ensure the secure cryptographic device deletes it securely from
   memory after usage.

   When presenting multiple documents, a reader can require a proof that
   multiple keys are associated to a single device.  Several protocols
   for a cryptographic proof of association are possible, such as
   [Verheul2024].  For example, a unit could prove in a zero-knowledge
   protocol knowledge of the association between two elliptic curve keys
   B1 = [bf1]D and B2 = [bf2]D, where bf1 and bf2 are multiplicative
   blinding factors for a common blinding public key D.  In this
   protocol, the association is known by the discrete logarithm of B2 =
   [bf2/bf1]B1 with respect to generator B1.  The unit can apply BL-
   Combine-Blinding-Factors to obtain values to compute this
   association.

3.  Generic HDK instantiations

3.1.  Using elliptic curves

   Instantiations of HDK using elliptic curves require the following
   cryptographic constructs:

   *  EC: An elliptic curve with elements of type Element and scalars of
      type Scalar, consisting of the functions:

      -  EC-Random(): Outputs a random Scalar k.

      -  EC-Add(A, B): Outputs the sum between Elements A and B.

      -  EC-Scalar-Mult(A, k): Outputs the scalar multiplication between
         Element A and Scalar k.

      -  EC-Scalar-Base-Mult(k): Outputs the scalar multiplication
         between the base Element and Scalar k.

      -  EC-Order(): Outputs the order of the base Element.

      -  EC-Serialize-Element(A): Outputs a byte string representing
         Element A.

   *  H2C: A hash-to-curve suite [RFC9380] for EC, providing the
      function:

      -  hash_to_field(msg, count): Outputs count EC Elements based on
         the result of cryptographically hashing msg (see [RFC9380],
         Section 5.2).

   def BL-Generate-Blinding-Key-Pair():
       sk = EC-Random()
       pk = EC-Scalar-Base-Mult(sk)
       return (pk, sk)

   def BL-Derive-Blinding-Factor(msg, ctx):
       bf = hash_to_field(msg, count) with the parameters:
           DST: ID || ctx
           F: GF(EC-Order()), the scalar field
               of the prime order subgroup of EC
           p: EC-Order()
           m: 1
           L: as defined in H2C
           expand_message: as defined in H2C
       return bf

3.2.  Using EC multiplicative blinding

   Such instantations of HDK use elliptic curves (see Using elliptic
   curves (Section 3.1)) and instantiate the following:

   def BL-Blind-Public-Key(pk, bf):
       pk' = EC-Scalar-Mult(pk, bf)
       return pk

   def BL-Blind-Private-Key(sk, bf):
       sk' = sk * bf mod EC-Order()
       return sk

   def BL-Combine-Blinding-Factors(bf1, bf2):
       bf = bf1 * bf2 mod EC-Order()
       return bf

3.3.  Using EC additive blinding

   Such instantations of HDK use elliptic curves (see Using elliptic
   curves (Section 3.1)) and instantiate the following:

   def BL-Blind-Public-Key(pk, bf):
       pk' = EC-Add(pk, EC-Scalar-Base-Mult(bf))
       return pk

   def BL-Blind-Private-Key(sk, bf):
       sk' = sk + bf mod EC-Order()
       return sk

   def BL-Combine-Blinding-Factors(bf1, bf2):
       bf = bf1 + bf2 mod EC-Order()
       return bf

3.4.  Using ECDH shared secrets

   Such instantiations of HDK use EC multiplicative blinding (see Using
   EC multiplicative blinding (Section 3.2)) and require the following
   cryptographic construct:

   *  ECDH: An Elliptic Curve Key Agreement Algorithm - Diffie-Hellman
      (ECKA-DH) [TR03111] with elliptic curve EC, consisting of the
      functions:

      -  ECDH-Create-Shared-Secret(sk_self, pk_other): Outputs a shared
         secret byte string representing an Element.

   In such instantiations, the reader provides an ephemeral public key
   reader_data.  The Authenticate function returns shared secret
   device_data consisting of a binary encoded x-coordinate Z_AB of an
   ECDH operation with the blinded private key.  Subsequently, the unit
   creates a message authentication code (MAC), such as in ECDH-MAC
   authentication defined in [ISO18013-5].  The reader verifies this MAC
   by performing an ECDH operation with its ephemeral private key and
   the blinded public key.

   These instantiations instantiate the following:

   def Authenticate(sk_device, reader_data, bf):
       P' = EC-Scalar-Mult(reader_data, bf)

       # Compute Z_AB within the secure cryptographic device.
       Z_AB = ECDH-Create-Shared-Secret(sk_device, P')

       return Z_AB

3.5.  Using EC digital signatures

   Such instantiations of HDK use EC additive blinding (see Using EC
   additive blinding (Section 3.3)) and require the following
   cryptographic construct:

   *  DSA: An EC digital signature algorithm , consisting of the
      functions:

      -  DSA-Sign(sk, msg): Outputs the signature (c, r) created using
         private signing key sk over byte string msg.

      -  DSA-Verify(signature, pk, msg): Outputs whether signature is a
         signature over msg using public verification key pk.

      -  DSA-Serialize(c, r): Outputs the byte array serialization of
         the signature (c, r).

      -  DSA-Deserialize(bytes): Outputs the signature (c, r)
         represented by byte string bytes.

   The reader is expected to create an input byte string reader_data
   with sufficient entropy for each challenge.

   The reader is expected to verify the proof device_data using DSA-
   Verify with the blinded public key.

3.6.  Using EC-SDSA signatures

   Such instantiations of HDK use EC digital signatures (see Using EC
   digital signatures (Section 3.5)) and EC digital and instantiate the
   following:

   *  DSA: An EC-SDSA (Schnorr) digital signature algorithm [TR03111].

   def Authenticate(sk_device, reader_data, bf):
       # Compute signature within the secure cryptographic device.
       signature = DSA-Sign(sk_device, reader_data)

       (c, s) = DSA-Deserialize(proof)
       s' = s + c * bf mod EC-Order()
       device_data = DSA-Serialize(c, s')
       return device_data

3.7.  Using ECDSA signatures

   Such instantiations of HDK use EC digital signatures (see Using EC
   digital signatures (Section 3.5)) and instantiate the following:

   *  DSA: An ECDSA digital signature algorithm [TR03111].

   def Authenticate(sk_device, reader_data, bf):
       # Blind private key and create signature
       # within the secure cryptographic device.
       sk' = BL-Blind-Private-Key(sk_device, bf)
       device_data = DSA-Sign(sk', reader_data)
       return device_data

   Due to potential patent claims, this document does not specify an
   instantiation with multi-party ECDSA signing, even though this would
   be theoretically possible using EC multiplicative blinding.

4.  Concrete HDK instantiations

   The RECOMMENDED instantiation is the HDK-ECDH-P256.  This avoids the
   risk of having the holder unknowingly producing a potentially non-
   repudiable signature over reader-provided data.  Secure cryptographic
   devices that enable a high level of assurance typically support
   managing ECDH keys with the P-256 elliptic curve.

4.1.  HDK-ECDH-P256

   This instantiation uses ECDH for proof of possession (see Using ECDH
   shared secrets (Section 3.4)) and for KEM.

   *  ID: "HDK-ECDH-P256-v1"

   *  Ns: 32

   *  H: SHA-256 [FIPS180-4] with:

      -  H1(msg): Implemented by computing H(ID || msg).

   *  EC: The NIST curve secp256r1 (P-256) [SEC2]

   *  ECDH: ECKA-DH with curve EC

   *  KEM: DHKEM(P-256, HKDF-SHA256) [RFC9180]

4.2.  HDK-ECDSA-P256

   This instantiation uses ECDSA for proof of possession (see Using
   ECDSA signatures (Section 3.7)) and ECDH for KEM.

   *  ID: "HDK-ECSDSA-P256-v1"

   *  Ns: 32

   *  H: SHA-256 [FIPS180-4] with:

      -  H1(msg): Implemented by computing H(ID || msg).

   *  EC: The NIST curve secp256r1 (P-256) [SEC2]

   *  DSA: ECDSA with curve EC.

   *  KEM: DHKEM(P-256, HKDF-SHA256) [RFC9180]

4.3.  HDK-ECSDSA-P256

   This instantiation uses EC-SDSA for proof of possession (see Using
   EC-SDSA signatures (Section 3.6)) and ECDH for KEM.

   *  ID: "HDK-ECSDSA-P256-v1"

   *  Ns: 32

   *  H: SHA-256 [FIPS180-4] with:

      -  H1(msg): Implemented by computing H(ID || msg).

   *  EC: The NIST curve secp256r1 (P-256) [SEC2]

   *  DSA: EC-SDSA-opt (the optimised EC-SDSA) with curve EC.

   *  KEM: DHKEM(P-256, HKDF-SHA256) [RFC9180]

5.  Application considerations

5.1.  Secure cryptographic device

   The HDK approach assumes that the holder controls a secure
   cryptographic device that protects the device key pair (pk_device,
   sk_device).  The device key is under sole control of the holder.

   In the context of [EU2024-1183], this device is typically called a
   Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device (WSCD), running a personalised
   Wallet Secure Cryptographic Application (WSCA) that exposes a Secure
   Cryptographic Interface (SCI) to a Wallet Instance (WI) running on a
   User Device (UD).  The WSCD is certified to protect access to the
   device private key with high attack potential resistance to achieve
   high level of assurance authentication as per [EU2015-1502].  This
   typically means that the key is associated with a strong possession
   factor and with a rate-limited Personal Identification Number (PIN)
   check as a knowledge factor, and the verification of both factors
   actively involve the WSCD.

   An example deployment of HDK in this context is illustrated below.

                                     +--------------------+

   The WSCA could be a single program or could be deployed in a
   distributed architecture, as illustrated below.

   +--------------+
   |User device   |
   |+------------+|
   ||WI          ||
   |++-----------+|
   | |SCI         |

   ||WSCA agent  ||
   |++-----------+|
   +-+------------+
     |WSCA protocol
    +v-----------+
    |WSCA service|
    +------------+

   In the case of a distributed WSCA, the UD contains a local component,
   here called WSCA agent, accessing an external and possibly remote
   WSCA service from one or more components over a WSCA protocol.  For
   example, the WSCA agent may be a local web API client and the WSCA
   service may be provided at a remote web API server.  In such cases,
   typically the WSCA service receives a high-assurance security
   evaluation, while the WSCA agent is assessed to not be able to
   compromise the system's security guarantees.

   The internal registry can be managed by the WSCA agent, by the WSCA
   service, or by the combination.  When the user device is a natural
   person’s mobile phone, WSCA agent management could provide better
   confidentiality protection against compromised WSCA service
   providers.  When the user device is a cloud server used by a legal
   person, and the legal person deploys its own WSCD, WSCA service
   management could provide better confidentiality protection against
   compromised Wallet Instance cloud providers.

   In a distributed WSCA architecture, the WSCA could internally apply
   distributed key generation.  A description of this is out of scope
   for the current document.

   The solution proposal discussed herein works in all any WSCD
   architecture that supports the required cryptographic primitives:

   *  In the case of HDK-ECDH-P256 (see Section 4.1):

      -  P-256 ECDH key pair generation

      -  P-256 ECDH key agreement

   *  In the case of HDK-ECDSA-P256 (see Section 4.2):

      -  P-256 ECDSA blinding key pair generation

      -  P-256 ECDSA blinded signature creation

   *  In the case of HDK-ECSDSA-P256 (see Section 4.3):

      -  P-256 EC-SDSA key pair generation

      -  P-256 EC-SDSA signature creation

   The other HDK operations can be performed in a WSCA or WSCA agent
   running on any UD, including hostile ones with limited sandboxing
   capabilities, such as in a smartphone's rich execution environment or
   in a personal computer web browser.

5.2.  Trust evidence

   Some issuers could require evidence from a solution provider of the
   security of the holder's cryptographic device.  This evidence can in
   the context of [EU2024-1183] be divided into initial "Wallet Trust
   Evidence" and related "Issuer Trust Evidence".  Each is a protected
   document that contains a trust evidence public key associated with a
   private key that is protected in the secure cryptographic device.
   With HDK, these public keys are specified as follows.

5.2.1.  Wallet Trust Evidence

   The Wallet Trust Evidence public key is the first level 0 HDK public
   key.  To achieve reader unlinkability, the wallet SHOULD limit access
   to a trusted person identification document provider only.

   To prevent association across identities, the solution provider MUST
   before issuing Wallet Trust Evidence ensure that (a) a newly
   generated device key pair is used and (b) the wallet follows the
   protocol so that the HDK output is bound to exactly this key.  For
   (a), the solution provider could rely on freshness of a key
   attestation and ensure that each device public key is attested only
   once.  For (b), the wallet could proof knowledge of the blinding
   factor bf with a Schnorr non-interactive zero-knowledge proof
   [RFC8235] with base point pk_device.  This would ensure that the root
   blinding key bf is not shared with the solution provider to reduce
   the risk of the solution provider unblinding future derived keys.

5.2.2.  Issuer Trust Evidence

   The Issuer Trust Evidence public key can be any other HDK public key.
   The solution provider MUST verify that the wallet knows the
   associated private key before issuing Issuer Trust Evidence.  The
   solution provider MUST ensure that sk_device is under sole control of
   the unit holder.  To achieve reader unlinkability, the unit MUST
   limit access of Issuer Trust Evidence to a single issuer.  Subsequent
   issuers within the same HDK tree do not need to receive any Issuer
   Trust Evidence, since they can derive equally secure keys by applying
   the remote HDK protocol to presented keys attested by trusted (other)
   issuers.

5.3.  Applying HDK in OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance

   In [draft-OpenID4VCI], the following terminology applies:

                     +===================+==========+
                     | OpenID4VCI        | HDK      |
                     +===================+==========+
                     | Credential        | document |
                     +-------------------+----------+
                     | Credential Issuer | issuer   |
                     +-------------------+----------+
                     | Verifier          | reader   |
                     +-------------------+----------+
                     | Wallet            | unit     |
                     +-------------------+----------+

                                 Table 1

   HDK enables unit and issuers cooperatively to establish the
   cryptographic key material that issued documents will be bound to.

   For the remote HDK protocol, HDK proposes an update to the OpenID4VCI
   endpoints.  This proposal is under discussion in openid/
   OpenID4VCI#359 (https://github.com/openid/OpenID4VCI/issues/359).  In
   the update, the unit shares a key encapsulation public key with the
   issuer, and the issuer returns a key handle.  Then documents can be
   re-issued, potentially in batches, using synchronised indices.
   Alternatively, re-issued documents can have their own key handles.

6.  Security considerations

6.1.  Confidentiality of key handles

   The key handles MUST be considered confidential, since they provide
   knowledge about the blinding factors.  Compromise of this knowledge
   could introduce undesired linkability.  In HDK, both the holder and
   the issuer know the key handle during issuance.

   In an alternative to HDK, the holder independently generates blinded
   key pairs and proofs of association, providing the issuer with zero
   knowledge about the blinding factors.  However, this moves the
   problem: the proofs of association would now need to be considered
   confidential.
